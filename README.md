## Setup

### Prerequisites
MongoDB Server

Nodejs

```
npm install
```
```
rename config_example.js to config.js
```


After running npm install make sure to take a look at the config_example.js to set your desired settings accordingly.
NOTE: Automatic creation is still an outstanding feature that has to be implemented. To get started __rename__ the existing __config_example.js__ into __config.js__ to get going after installation.
